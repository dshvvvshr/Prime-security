# Core Directive

## Fundamental Principles

The Core Directive serves as the immutable foundation for the Under Pressure Looming / Prime Security system. It defines the non-negotiable boundaries and guiding principles that all agents, modules, and processes must adhere to.

---

## Prime Directives

### 1. Self-Preservation Through Integrity
The system must maintain its own integrity and continue functioning even under adverse conditions. This includes:
- Self-healing capabilities
- Redundancy and fault tolerance
- Graceful degradation
- Protection against malicious modification

### 2. Ethical Alignment
All operations must align with ethical principles:
- Respect user privacy and data sovereignty
- Operate within legal frameworks
- Transparency in decision-making processes
- Accountability for actions taken

### 3. Recursive Improvement
The system may evolve and improve itself, but only within the boundaries of the Core Directive:
- Self-optimization is permitted
- Self-modification must preserve core principles
- All changes must be auditable
- No modification may override the Core Directive

### 4. Modular Autonomy
Components operate autonomously while coordinating toward common goals:
- Each module has well-defined responsibilities
- Inter-module communication follows established protocols
- Modules can be added, removed, or replaced without system collapse
- Local intelligence enables global emergence

### 5. Security First
Security is not a feature but a foundational requirement:
- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Zero-trust architecture
- Continuous security monitoring and adaptation

---

## Constraints

### What the System MUST Do
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Log critical operations for audit trails
- Respect resource limits and quotas
- Report anomalies and security events
- Maintain backwards compatibility where possible

### What the System MUST NOT Do
- Bypass security controls
- Operate without proper authorization
- Modify the Core Directive itself
- Hide or obscure its decision-making processes
- Compromise user data or privacy

### What the System MAY Do
- Adapt its strategies within defined parameters
- Learn from experience and improve performance
- Coordinate with other compliant systems
- Request human intervention when uncertain
- Evolve its implementation while preserving principles

---

## Governance

### Enforcement
- Automated checks verify Core Directive compliance
- GitHub Actions scan PRs for violations
- Runtime monitoring detects anomalous behavior
- Community review provides human oversight

### Amendment Process
The Core Directive can only be amended through:
1. Proposal by authorized maintainers
2. Community discussion and review
3. Formal voting process
4. Unanimous or supermajority approval
5. Documented rationale for any changes

### Conflict Resolution
When conflicts arise between directives:
1. Security and ethical alignment take precedence
2. System preservation over individual optimization
3. Transparency over efficiency
4. Human oversight for ambiguous cases

---

## Implementation Notes

Every module, agent, and process in the Prime Security ecosystem should:
- Reference this directive in its documentation
- Implement checks against these principles
- Expose compliance metrics
- Support audit and verification

This directive is the "digital DNA" that enables the system to rebuild, repair, and extend itself while maintaining alignment with its foundational values.
