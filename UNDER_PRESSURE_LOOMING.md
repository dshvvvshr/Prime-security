# Under Pressure Looming – Foundational Tools and Research

This document tracks external tools, frameworks, and theory that can plug
into or extend the Under Pressure Looming project.

## 1. AI Integration & Multi-Agent Frameworks

Modern AI systems emphasize modularity and inter-AI communication. We want
infrastructure where multiple agents and models can cooperate around the
Core Directive.

Key ecosystems:

- **Agora Protocol**  
  Open, decentralized communication protocol for LLM-based agents to
  exchange messages efficiently (large reductions in token overhead).

- **LangChain / LangGraph**  
  Frameworks for chaining tools and building multi-agent workflows.  
  - LangChain: abstractions for agents, tools, and chains.  
  - LangGraph: event-driven graph workflows with memory, persistence,
    and streaming for complex agent systems.

- **Microsoft AutoGen**  
  Python framework for building multi-agent LLM systems (human-in-the-loop
  or fully autonomous). Good for experiments with specialized agents that
  negotiate and collaborate.

- **Other useful tools**  
  - Hugging Face Transformers + Pipelines for model ensembles.  
  - Ray / Dapr for distributed orchestration.  
  - Standard web APIs (REST, gRPC, OpenAI function calling) to bridge
    different models and services.

**Design idea for this project:**  
Treat each participating AI (GitHub Agent, Copilot, external LLMs, etc.) as
a node in a multi-agent network that shares a common kernel prompt
(Core Directive) and uses these frameworks for coordination.

## 2. Cryptographic Foundations & Security Libraries

Strong cryptography is the bedrock of any security system. Understanding the
low-level implementations helps ensure correct usage and enables advanced
security work.

Key libraries and resources:

- **OpenSSL**  
  The de facto standard cryptographic library for SSL/TLS and general
  cryptographic operations. Node.js's `crypto` module is backed by OpenSSL.
  
  To study or work with OpenSSL source code:
  ```bash
  git clone git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git
  ```
  
  See [OpenSSL Development Guide](./docs/OPENSSL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed
  instructions on building, testing, and integrating OpenSSL.

- **libsodium**  
  Modern, easy-to-use cryptographic library with high-level APIs. Good for
  developers who want strong defaults without deep cryptographic expertise.

- **BoringSSL / LibreSSL**  
  Forks of OpenSSL with different goals:
  - BoringSSL: Google's fork focused on Chrome/Android needs
  - LibreSSL: OpenBSD's fork focused on code quality and security

- **Cryptographic Standards**  
  - NIST FIPS 140-2/140-3 for validated cryptographic modules
  - PKCS standards for public key cryptography
  - RFC documents for cryptographic protocols (TLS, SSH, etc.)

**Design idea for this project:**  
Use Node.js's `crypto` module (backed by OpenSSL) for all cryptographic
operations while maintaining awareness of the underlying implementations.
Document all cryptographic choices and align with industry standards and
the Core Directive's security-first approach.

## 3. Self-Building & Self-Reconfiguring Systems

We are interested in systems that can assemble, repair, and improve
themselves while staying aligned.

Important concepts and projects:

- **Artificial DNA / Organic Computing**  
  A "blueprint" is stored in each node of a distributed system. The nodes
  can self-organize and rebuild the overall system from this DNA, with
  self-repair and runtime reconfiguration.

- **Autonomic Computing**  
  IBM's vision of self-managing systems:
  - self-configuring
  - self-healing
  - self-optimizing
  - self-protecting  
  This offloads administration to the system itself.

- **Modular Robotics**  
  Self-reconfigurable robots built from many identical modules that can
  rearrange in response to tasks and environments. Swarms of modules
  communicate and coordinate to adapt.

- **Robot Metabolism (Columbia, 2025)**  
  "Truss Link" modules that magnetically connect, grow, and repair
  structures by consuming parts from other robots or the environment. A
  literal physical example of self-building machines.

**Design idea for this project:**  
Represent the architecture of Under Pressure Looming as a kind of
"digital DNA" (Core Directive + module definitions) so that automation
(GitHub Actions, agents, external AIs) can reconstruct and extend the
system from that blueprint.

## 4. Accessing & Simulating Restricted Content

Some development paths involve learning from or testing against systems
that are partially blocked, geofenced, or censored.

Main approaches:

- **Circumvention Tools**  
  - Lantern, Psiphon, Tor with obfuscated bridges, etc.  
  - These dynamically change transport protocols and obfuscate traffic to
    route around censorship.

- **Proxies & Tunnels**  
  - VPNs and SSH tunnels to foreign servers.  
  - Custom or corporate proxies.  
  - Pluggable transports such as meek or v2ray-style protocols.

- **Mirrors & Archives**  
  - Alternate domains/IPs or mirrors when the primary site is blocked.  
  - Cached pages and historical versions via the Internet Archive /
    Wayback Machine.

- **Developer Techniques**  
  - Headless browsers (Selenium, Playwright) configured with proxies.  
  - Containerized environments that emulate different network regions.  
  - Browser DevTools to inspect how blocking is implemented.

**Design idea for this project:**  
Abstract this into a "Content Access Layer" that can use different
backends (archives, mirrors, proxies) but still respects laws and the Core
Directive.

## 5. Theoretical Foundations (Recursion, Autonomy, Resilience)

The project sits on top of several deep ideas:

- **Self-Organization & Cybernetics**  
  From Ashby and later work: systems whose components interact locally to
  produce coherent global patterns. Self-organization is a key mechanism
  both in biology and in engineered distributed systems.

- **Autonomic / Autopoietic Systems**  
  Inspired by biological autopoiesis (systems that maintain and reproduce
  themselves) and IBM's autonomic computing. The emphasis is on systems
  that "take care of themselves" at runtime.

- **Autonomy & Agency**  
  Hierarchical control models (e.g. Stafford Beer's Viable System Model)
  and recursive self-reference: systems that can inspect, reason about,
  and modify their own structure or code.

- **Resilience & Antifragility**  
  Beyond robustness (resisting shocks), antifragile systems actually
  benefit from disruption. This is a desirable property for an evolving
  AI-governance stack.

- **Ethical / Philosophical Considerations**  
  - Machine consciousness frameworks (Integrated Information Theory,
    global workspace, etc.) intersect with how we structure recursive,
    self-aware architectures.  
  - Hod Lipson and others argue that as robots and AI become pervasive,
    they must be able to maintain themselves responsibly – not just
    technically, but behaviorally.

**Design idea for this project:**  
Use these concepts to justify and guide a system that can refactor itself
over time but is constrained by the Core Directive as its non-negotiable
boundary.

## 6. Modular / Evolutionary Platforms and Projects

We want a "hyper-modular" ecosystem where components can be swapped,
extended, or recombined.

Key patterns and platforms:

- **Microservices & Containers**
  - Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, etc.  
  - Each service is a deployable unit; orchestration handles scaling,
    routing, and resilience.

- **Plugin / Extension Frameworks**
  - Eclipse/OSGi, Node-RED, VSCode extensions, Grafana plugins, Jenkins
    plugins.  
  - Core runtime plus a graph of dynamically loadable modules.

- **Distributed Event / Actor Systems**
  - Apache Kafka, Pulsar, NATS, Dapr, Akka, etc.  
  - Components communicate via messages or actors, enabling loose coupling
    and easy replacement.

- **P2P & Federated Platforms**
  - BitTorrent, ZeroNet, GNUnet, Tor/I2P, Fediverse (ActivityPub).  
  - Resilient web, decentralized identity and content distribution.

- **Blockchain & Edge Compute**
  - Ethereum / Hyperledger smart contracts.  
  - IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized storage.  
  - Edge nodes running AI and services closer to users.

**Design idea for this project:**  
Treat Under Pressure Looming as a set of modules and services that could
live across traditional infra (Kubernetes, GitHub Actions) and more
decentralized substrates (P2P, blockchain, edge nodes).

## 7. Emerging & Speculative Research

Frontier work that strongly resonates with the project:

- **Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)**  
  Neural "cells" learn local rules to grow and repair complex 2D patterns.
  This shows how differentiable, trainable self-organizing systems can
  regenerate after damage, similar to biological morphogenesis.

- **Robot Metabolism**  
  Modular robots with a primitive "metabolism" – they can reshape and
  expand by integrating new parts, including parts from other robots.

- **Neuromorphic Hardware**
  - Spiking neural chips (e.g. Intel Loihi) for low-energy, brain-like
    computation.  
  - Potential for running self-organizing, event-driven policies at the
    hardware level.

- **Quantum-Augmented AI**
  - Early research into quantum-inspired or quantum-accelerated learning
    algorithms.

- **Synthetic Biology & Living Media**
  - Evolutionary algorithms working in wet lab setups (genetic circuits,
    bio-computing) as long-term speculative directions.

- **Decentralized AI Governance & Mesh Agents**
  - Proposals for distributed AI collectives that vote, negotiate, or
    share accountability across a network.

**Design idea for this project:**  
Treat these as inspiration for long-term directions:
neural-CA-style self-repair in software, modular "metabolism" in infra,
and governance schemes that work like an adaptive organism rather than a
static bureaucracy.

## 8. How This Feeds Back Into the Repo

Next steps that connect this research to concrete work:

1. **Issues & Roadmap**  
   Turn each section above into one or more GitHub Issues
   (e.g. "Explore Agora or LangGraph integration," "Design digital DNA
   representation," "Spec for Content Access Layer," etc.).

2. **Architecture Doc**  
   Create `notes/ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT.md` that references:
   - Core Directive
   - Multi-agent frameworks
   - Self-building concepts
   - Governance and monitoring

3. **Automation**  
   Use GitHub Actions and Agents to:
   - Scan new PRs for Core Directive conflicts.  
   - Suggest modularization and refactors.  
   - Keep this research document updated with links to actual code.

This doc is a living index. As new tools and ideas show up, they should be
added here and then wired into concrete tasks and code.
